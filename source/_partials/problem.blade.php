    <h2>The all too common problem with church websites</h2>
    <div class="problems">
      <img src="img/idea.jpg" alt="">
      <p><b>Imagine a common scenario with me</b>. You find someone to make a church website, paid or free. With great enthusiasm, you begin communication and start to find designs you like. You start sending content over. Your church website is 75% complete.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problems">
      <img src="img/tangled.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Then…You get busy. Your designer lost interest in your project. You can’t find emails that were sent. On and on you go. Finally, after months of waiting, your church site is up, but it’s not what you expected, nor do you want to maintain it. So, you ask for a volunteer.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="bottom">With honest and good intentions, a faithful member of your local church comes forward to help. Now, that individual needs to learn how to maintain your church website, but it’s more that anticipated.
        <br>
        <span class='boldProblem'>You end up with a semi-complete website with multiple “Coming Soon” pages or a site you wish was better.</span></p>

    <p>Simply put, we make <b>simple church websites</b> to help pastors avoid the hassle of extended communication or the wasted time it takes to maintain a church website. With over the 20+ years of designing for churches, we have learned the best way for a church to have a professional online presence is to have a simple church website.  <em>Weâ€™ve created a completely new way to do church websites that solves common frustrations</em>.</p>
